# hubspot-revenue-leak-detection-engine
Installable HubSpot app + Breeze Agent that identifies hidden revenue leaks across the full lifecycle. Analyzes Deals, Jobs, Placements, Contracts, UTM sources, renewals, and invoices to detect underbilling, missed cross-sells, dropped handoffs, orphaned accounts, invalid stage transitions, delayed billing, and untriggered renewal opportunities.
